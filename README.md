# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using a Logistic Regression model.  
The model is trained on the Fake and True news datasets from Kaggle.

## 🚀 Tech Stack Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📌 Dataset Source
